Code to scrape each NFL team's roster page and create CSVs of their roster. Intended to be run daily.

Simply set up your local repository and run get_rosters.py!

Future improvements:
- create a batch file to automate daily running
- write code to compare a team's roster from any 2 days and find changes
- create transaction file for each team from rosters
- add option to keep webpage files instead of auto-deleting
